# QAProject

Inventory Managment System

This project involved creating a relational database using three tables (Users,Products,Orders) in SQL. The Database was then accessed and manipulated using user inputs through a console java application. This project helped encapsulate all fundamental modules learnt over the first 5 weeks of training.

Built With
Maven - Dependency Management
Versioning
GitHub was used as an external repository to keep regular backups of the application source code. Creating multiple fall-back versions proved essential in reducing the amount of time lost. When making changes during development and encountering problems, it was easy to revert to an older version that was known to be working to help distinguish where the errors were originating.
