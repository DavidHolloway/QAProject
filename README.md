Versioning
GitHub was used as an external repository to keep regular backups of the application source code. Creating multiple fall-back versions proved essential in reducing the amount of time lost. When making changes during development and encountering problems, it was easy to revert to an older version that was known to be working to help distinguish where the errors were originating.
